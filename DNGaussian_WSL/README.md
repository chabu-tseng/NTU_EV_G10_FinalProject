## Installation

Tested on WSL2, Ubuntu 24.04.1, CUDA 11.3, PyTorch 1.12.1, GCC 9.5.0

See [installation_guide.md](installation_guide.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Test

### Use COLMAP Dataset

See [test_colmap.md](test_colmap.md)

### Use Our Hand Data

See [test_hand_data.md](test_hand_data.md)

## Evaluation

### LLFF

1. Download LLFF from [the official download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1).

2. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_llff_dtu.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_llff> --benchmark LLFF
   ```

3. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   bash scripts/run_llff.sh data/llff/fern output/llff/fern ${gpu_id}
   ```

### DTU

1. Download DTU dataset

   - Download the DTU dataset "Rectified (123 GB)" from the [official website](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36/), and extract it.
   - Download masks (used for evaluation only) from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yt5T3LJ9DZDiHbtd9PDFNHqJAd7wt-_E/view?usp=sharing).

2. Organize DTU for few-shot setting

   ```bash
   bash scripts/organize_dtu_dataset.sh $rectified_path
   ```

3. Format

   - Poses: following [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), run `convert.py` to get the poses and the undistorted images by COLMAP.
   - Render Path: following [LLFF](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF) to get the `poses_bounds.npy` from the COLMAP data. (Optional)

4. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_llff_dtu.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_dtu> --benchmark DTU
   ```

5. Set the mask path and the expected output model path in `copy_mask_dtu.sh` for evaluation. (default: "data/dtu/submission_data/idrmasks" and "output/dtu")

6. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   bash scripts/run_dtu.sh data/dtu/scan8 output/dtu/scan8 ${gpu_id}
   ```

### Blender

1. Download the NeRF Synthetic dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1?usp=sharing).

2. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_blender.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_blender>
   ```

3. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   # there are some special settings for different scenes in the Blender dataset, please refer to "run_blender.sh".
   bash scripts/run_blender.sh data/nerf_synthetic/drums output/blender/drums ${gpu_id}
   ```

## Reproducing Results

Due to the randomness of the densification process and random initialization, the metrics may be unstable in some scenes, especially PSNR.

### Checkpoints and Results

You can download our provided checkpoints from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8XGg1MXJDb-bK3NAEo5Gw2GLLByF7FM?usp=sharing). These results are reproduced with a lower error tolerance bound to keep aligned with this repo, which is different from what we use in the paper. This could lead to higher metrics but worse visualization.

### MVS Point Cloud Initialization

If more stable performance is needed, we recommend trying the dense initialization from [FSGS](https://github.com/VITA-Group/FSGS).

Here we provide an example script for LLFF that just modifies a few hyperparameters to adapt our method to this initialization:

```bash
# Following FSGS to get the "data/llff/$<scene>/3_views/dense/fused.ply" first
bash scripts/run_llff_mvs.sh data/llff/$<scene> output_dense/$<scene> ${gpu_id}
```

However, there may still be some randomness.

For reference, the best results we get in two random tests are as follows:

| PSNR   | LPIPS | SSIM (SK) | SSIM (GS) |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | --------- |
| 19.942 | 0.228 | 0.682     | 0.687     |

where GS refers to the calculation originally provided by 3DGS, and SK denotes calculated by sklearn which is used in most previous NeRF-based methods.

## Customized Dataset

Similar to Gaussian Splatting, our method can read standard COLMAP format datasets. Please customize your sampling rule in `scenes/dataset_readers.py`, and see how to organize a COLMAP-format dataset from raw RGB images referring to our preprocessing of DTU.
